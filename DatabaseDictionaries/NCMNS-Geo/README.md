The NCMNS Geology Collection Database is a Microsoft Access-based application. The system is divided into two components using a split architectural design, allowing multiple people to simultaneously interact with the underlying data. The "code file" contains front-end logic, including all form and report objects. Underlying the front-end is a 'code file' that stores all the collections data in a centrally located file storage device.   
  
Purchased more than 20 years ago, the system was initially engineered for the Ichthyology Collection. One by one, each collection adopted a modified clone of the original. Over the following years, the functionality provided by the MS Access systems sufficiently met the needs of all eight collections. However, as the collections grew and technology evolved, the ability of the software to meet the increasing demands of staff began to trend downward. By 2017, it was clear that the days of the MS Access Databases were numbered. A new solution to the management of digitized collections was needed. In 2018, the Research and Collections staff explored multiple collections management systems, eventually agreeing to move forward with Specify. Over the next year, the three Paleontology Collections (Invertebrate, Vertebrate, and Paleobtonay) and Non-molluscan Invertebrates successfully migrated from MS Access to Specify 6. The migration of the remaining biological collections is slated for 2022-2024. 
While Specify has worked great for the biological and paleontological collections, Geology remains unsupported, giving rise to this project.  

When originally conceived, this project had two primary goals:  
1. A complete overhaul of the existing Geology Collection data model.  
2. Determine if Specify in its current form could be customized to support Geology collections. 
  
After a few discussions with outside colleagues, we discovered that we were far from alone in this endeavor. Accordingly, we significantly expanded the project's scope to address needs in the broader collections community.  
1. Develop a model that would allow Specify to support Geology Collections   
2. Create a standardized data model with a set of vocabularies for Mineralogy/Petrology Collections.
